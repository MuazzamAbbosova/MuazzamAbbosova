        <h1>History of Mobile Phones</h1>
        <p>
            The journey of mobile phones began in the mid-20th century with early wireless communication systems. In 1973, Martin Cooper of Motorola made history by making the first handheld mobile phone call using the <span class="highlight">DynaTAC prototype</span>. These devices were bulky, expensive, and had limited functionality, but they marked the start of a new era in communication technology.

            In the 1980s and 1990s, mobile phone technology advanced with the introduction of 1G and 2G networks. Analog systems transitioned to digital, improving voice clarity and enabling services like SMS. Devices became smaller, cheaper, and more user-friendly. Companies like <span class="highlight">Nokia</span> and Motorola dominated this period.

            By the 2000s, the arrival of 3G networks and smartphones revolutionized the industry. Appleâ€™s iPhone, launched in 2007, set a new standard for mobile technology with its sleek design and app ecosystem. Today, with the advent of 4G and 5G networks, mobile phones continue to evolve, shaping global communication and innovation.
